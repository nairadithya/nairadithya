Hi there ðŸ‘‹
</h2>

Hello, I am Adithya. I'm a student at Amrita School Of Engineering, Bangalore. I am currently pursuing a B. Tech in Artificial Intelligence And Data Science.

I'm deeply interested in artificial intelligence, software, science and art.

I am a believer in the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org), and using technology to express yourself.

I'm a co-leader of [The Journal Society](https://jsoc.amrita.town) in Amrita, which is a group of people coming together on a regular basis to discuss scientific and mathematical ideas in a rigorous manner.

Check out [amrita.town](https://amrita.town) if you're an Amrita student.
